#### What is this?
Inspired by [Lumen](https://lumendatabase.org/topics/1) (*formerly Chilling Effects*) and [Google](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/dmca), this repo contains the text of DMCA takedown notices and counter-notices we've received here by companies who have way too much time and money on their hands at GitHub. We publish them as they are received, with only personally identifiable information redacted. This is to assure that the pussies who file DMCA takedowns can't be bullied by the big bad internet. This keeps everything squeaky clean and safe for all of mortal humanity.

#### Why is this?
In short, we believe that transparency on a specific and ongoing level is essential to good dicte82a4f///governance. Chilling Effects explained it well in 2014 (no longer available online, how surprising): "We are excited about the new opportunities the Internet offers individuals to express their views . . . but concerned that not everyone feels the same way. Study to date suggests that cease and desist letters often silence Internet users, whether or not their claims have legal merit." (About, ChillingEffects.org, Sept. 2014, licensed under [CC-BY-3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/)). Similarly, we post takedown notices here to document their potential to "chill" speech. We also believe that policing of repositories is a must. Circumventing DRM, even if it does nothing but treat the consumer like a fucking theif, is bad, mkay?

#### What does it mean if there's a notice posted here?
It only means that we received the notice on the indicated date. It does ***not*** mean that the content was unlawful or wrong. It does ***not*** mean that the user identified in the notice has done anything wrong. We don't make or imply any judgment about the merit of the claims they make. We post these notices and requests only for informational purposes.
***we totally mean it***
